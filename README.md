# datamining-final-project

Our mission is to conduct sentiment analysis on the most popular spotify genre's playlist's lyrics. In this analysis, we will present frequent vocabulary, popularity correlations, and sentiment analysis of the lyrics used to determine the positivity level of each genre (Pop, Rock, Country, Metal, and Rap). This analysis will hopefully lead to a better understanding of modern music's sentiment.


I encourage you to learn "git", the coding language used for GitHub, below is an intro youtube video and should be plenty of info to use it properly with this project.

Alternatively, here is a link to an article that shows how to use Git and the GitHub desktop to clone and share the project.
